Hypothetical scenario: A company found this malware on their internet-facing IIS server and needs your halp to determine the ramifications of this infection. Help them answer the follow questions:
- What to look for in network logs to determine if the malware succesfully communicated with its command & control (C2) server?  
  (Both type of traffic as well as actual C2 domains are interesting here.)
- Does this malware implement any lateral movement, i.e. could this have spread to the CEO's computer?
- Could this malware have had any impact on the customers of the company?
- What is the impact of this malware on a workstation?
